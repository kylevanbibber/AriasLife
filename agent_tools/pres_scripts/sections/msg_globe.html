<span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span><span class="couple"> and <span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span></span>, before I go over the permanent benefits, they've asked us to show this letter so that you can see why American Income was chosen to provide this program<span class="script-type HARDCARD"> to all of the members</span>. <span class="TECHNICALChar">SHOW LETTER</span>

<p>So basically, <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span><span class="couple"> and <span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span></span>, what it's saying is, if you like the benefits then you should try to qualify today. If they don't make sense, then don't try to qualify. Either way, YES or NO, that decision needs to be made today, during your service period, in fairness to all the other members waiting to qualify. The good thing about the benefits is that they are pretty much a no-brainer; you'll know at the end whether it's something that will fill a need for you or not. Does that make sense <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span><span class="couple"> and <span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span></span>? Are we on the same page? <span class="TECHNICALChar">Visibly nod your head and make sure to get agreement; do not move on until you have gotten an agreement from both</span></p>
