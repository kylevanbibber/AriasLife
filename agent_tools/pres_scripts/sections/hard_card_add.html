The FIRST benefit is your Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment benefit. Last year our company paid out nearly $5 million in these accidental policies. Here's how it works: When you die from an accident, it will pay <span class="VERBALChar output addOutput">$3,000</span> to <span class="couple VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span><span class="single">your beneficiary</span>. It may not seem like much, but when you die suddenly, this can help cover some of the expenses that your family will be dealing with after you're gone. Also, if you were to lose both hands, both feet, sight in both eyes, or any combination of the two, it will pay <span class="VERBALChar output addOutput">$3,000</span> to you. And if you're just having a bad day and you lose one hand, one foot, or sight in one eye, it will pay out <span class="VERBALChar output addOutput" data-show-half="true">$1,500</span> to you. This is provided to you by <span class="VERBALChar groupOutput"></span> for being a member in good standing. Pretty nice, right?
