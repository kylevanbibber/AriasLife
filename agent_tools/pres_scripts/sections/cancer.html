The last concern has to deal with cancer. Have you ever had any form of cancer? Has anyone in your family ever had cancer? Parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, anyone blood related?
<p><b>IF YES:</b> I'm sorry to hear that, what kind of cancer if you don't mind me asking? Were they able to beat it? Do you know how much the expenses were?</p>
<p>The good news is there's a lot of technology nowadays to keep people alive, but what's keeping people alive is killing everyone financially. Did you know that 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women are diagnosed with cancer? Most people have health and life insurance, but more commonly we're seeing a lot of people getting cancer insurance.</p>
<p>People love our cancer plan because:
<ol>
<li>It's a <span class="VERBALChar">$100,000</span> pot of money that can be used toward cancer expenses.</li>
<li>The money goes directly to YOU, not the insurance company! So, you can use it for anything AND it will pay IN ADDITION to any other insurance coverage you may have.</li>
<li>If you beat cancer and get it again, you can continue to use this policy until all the money has been exhausted, and once it's been exhausted you no longer have to pay for it.</li>
</ol>
	</p>
<p>The best part is that this comes with the Freedom of Choice benefit. So, even if you never use it, you'll always get a check for your family in the end.</p>
