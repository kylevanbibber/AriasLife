Now, onto the best part, the permanent benefits! <span class="script-type HARDCARD">Just like the <span class="VERBALChar groupOutput"></span> letter states</span><span class="script-type WILLKIT CHILDSAFE REFERRAL">Just like we mentioned before</span>, you're not automatically allowed to enroll. You do have to qualify, and if you're too high of a risk, they WON'T let you in. My job is to serve you and your family so I'm going to ask a few questions just to get an idea of what your family needs.
<ul>
<li><span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, your date of birth is DOB, correct?</li>
<span class="couple"><li><span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span>, what is your date of birth?</li></span>
<span class="children"><li>What's the name of your oldest child under 18? What's their date of birth?</li></span>
	</ul>
<p><strong>Preliminary Medical Questions</strong></p>
	<ul>
<li>Do you take any prescription medications?</li>
<li>Have you ever had any health issues in your lifetime, any family history of Cancer, Diabetes or Heart Disease?</li>
<li>Have you ever had any arrests including DUI?</li>
<li>Have either of you used any tobacco or marijuana in the past 12 months?</li>
	</ul>
<p><strong>Househole Information</strong></p>
<p>Okay, since your need for coverage is based on the income that you provide for your family,</p>
	<ul>
<li><span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, how much do you make per hour?</li>
<li><span class="TECHNICALChar">If they don't know hourly</span> What is your monthly take home pay after taxes?</li>
<span class="couple"><li>And <span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span> how much do you make per hour?</li>
<li><span class="TECHNICALChar">If they don't know hourly</span> What is your monthly take home pay after taxes?</li></span>
<li><strong>Work insurance: </strong><span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, like we talked about earlier, most people have life insurance through work, but just remember, we can't rely on that forever because when you retire, change jobs, or lose your job, you'll lose all of that coverage. That's why they have us out here to set up your permanent benefits. Are we on the same page? But just so we have it, how much life insurance do you have through work?</li>
		<li><strong>Outside insurance: </strong>Do you have any life insurance outside of work yet?</li>
	<ul>
<li>Yes: Great! Is that accidental or term?</li>
<li>No: Okay, well don't worry, that's why <span class="script-type WILLKIT CHILDSAFE REFERRAL">they</span><span class="script-type HARDCARD">your group</span> set this up.</li>
		</ul>
<li>Do you use a checking account, savings account, or both?</li>
</ul>
