The first area they are concerned with is when you are injured in any type of accident. Have <span class="couple">either one of </span>you thought about what you will do when you get injured in an accident? Well, the Labor Advisory Board and American Income have given it a lot of thought.

<p>Their concern isn't that your medical bills won't be taken care of. You have health insurance to take care of that. When it's job related, workers compensation is there, and a lot of members have some form of disability insurance as well. But the major concerns is your lost wages and all of the other expenses that start adding up. <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span> when you end up in the hospital, even though your medical bills are taken care of, no one is paying you to be there, right? <span class="couple"><span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span> when you get that phone call, you won't be working either. You'll be THERE by his side and vice versa.</span> <span class="children">God forbid anything happens to one of the children, you'll definitely take time off work to be by their side, right?</span> Because of that, your benefit plan will pay money directly to you when you <span class="couple"><span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span>, </span><span class="children">or the children </span>are receiving treatment for any kind of accident.</p>
