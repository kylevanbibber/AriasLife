<div style="margin-top: 10px;">You're right! You don't need this right NOW. Everything is good at the moment. This is a lot like a fire extinguisher. If you wait until the fire starts, it's going to be too late. This is the kind of thing you get BEFORE you need it. It's better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it! Believe me, what <span class="planType hourPower"><strong>2 hours per week</strong></span><span class="planType recBasic"><strong>the cost of the RECOMMENDED plan</strong></span> means to you right now is nothing compared to what these benefits will mean to your family when the fire starts. The most important thing is to get started but keep it comfortable. Of course, this is going to be a small adjustment to make but which option do you choose to protect your family, <span class="planType hourPower"><strong>2 hours per week</strong></span><span class="planType recBasic"><strong>the RECOMMENDED plan</strong></span> or <span class="planType hourPower"><strong>1 hour per week</strong></span><span class="planType recBasic"><strong>the BASIC plan</strong></span>?
