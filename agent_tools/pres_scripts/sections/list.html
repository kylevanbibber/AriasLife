	<h1>List of Concerns</h1>
</div>
<p>Do you see The Labor Advisory Board right here? Well, they narrowed it down to 5 major concerns that all the members were having:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of Permanent Benefits-</strong> Like we said before, most people have workplace benefits, but as soon as we retire, change jobs, or lose our job, we lose those benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Funeral and Final Expenses-</strong> They found that when someone dies, the family is left with the burden of paying for the funeral all at once. That was a huge problem for a lot of famlies.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Income-</strong> What happens to your paycheck when you pass away? Exactly, it's gone! That's another huge problem!</li>
<li><strong>Debt and Mortgage Protection-</strong> What happens to your debt and mortgage payments when you pass away?  Exactly! The mortgage payments are left behind for the family to deal with.</li>
<li><strong>Insurability and Affordability-</strong> The major problem here and why some people don't have these problems taken care of yet, is because they thought it would be too expensive or that they couldn't qualify. So, with this program, they're making sure the members can afford and qualify for protection to fix these problems.</li>
