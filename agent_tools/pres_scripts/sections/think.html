<div style="margin-top: 10px;">That's not a problem. I understand how you feel. But when you think about it, there are only three times when we actually think about life insurance.
<ol>
<li>When somebody close to us dies.</li>
<li>When we have a near death experience.</li>
<li>When I show up and I kinda force you to think about it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The truth is, you probably weren't thinking about this before I got here and you won't think about it when I leave. It will go on the backburner like a lot of other things. However, it will remain a PROBLEM that needs to be fixed. The only way we can fix this PROBLEM is by getting your program started today, BUT KEEPING IT COMFORTABLE! Most members are enrolling at <span class="planType hourPower"><strong>2 hours per week</strong></span><span class="planType recBasic"><strong>the RECOMMENDED plan</strong></span>, but then some members are going with <span class="planType hourPower"><strong>1 hour per week</strong></span><span class="planType recBasic"><strong>the BASIC plan</strong></span> just to get their foot in the door. Which one works best for you?</p>
