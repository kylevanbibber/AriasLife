<h1>Rolling Referrals</h1>
<span class="TECHNICALChar smallfont">At the end, pull up the list of refs collected earlier from <strong>Referrals, Sponsors, View</strong>.</span>
<p><span class="VERBALChar"><span class="memberOutput"></span><span class="couple"> and <span class="spouseOutput"></span></span></span>, out of everyone that you listed for the benefits (child safe, AIL +, Free Will Kits, $2k AD&amp;D, catch up program...) Which two families do you believe would benefit from this program the most?
Ok great! By sponsoring them, that's going to waive the cost on the benefit package for them and one of the hardest parts about my job is when I reach out to the families that were sponsored for these benefits, and they don't know who I am. They end up thinking that I'm just a telemarketer and hang up on me. So, here's what we need to do. Let's go ahead and give them a call right now from your phone, even if they don't pick up, we're going to leave a message. Just make sure you put it on speaker so we can all hear each other. Let's start with your <strong>(pick one of the two)</strong>. Just tell them that your benefits rep is on the line and needs to explain a few things. Go ahead and give him a call right now so we can fill him in.</p>
<strong>PHONE CALL:</strong><br>
<span class="TECHNICALChar smallfont">Let them introduce you as their benefits rep that wants to explain some things to them. Then take over the call. Either on speaker phone or a three way call.</span>
<p>Hello, <span class="VERBALChar">REFERRAL</span>. This is <span class="VERBALChar agentOutput"></span>. I'm sitting here on a Zoom meeting with <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span> and I was explaining the benefits that they get<span class="script-type HARDCARD"> through the <span class="VERBALChar groupOutput"></span></span>. When I was talking about the <span class="TECHNICALChar smallfont"><strong>PICK 1 or 2 OF THESE:</strong> Child Safe Kits, Will Kit, Health Services Discount Card, 2k free death benefit</span> they thought about you. So they took care of the cost on a whole benefit package for you and now I just need to deliver and explain it to you. We're almost done here, so I could meet up with you in about an hour OR we could schedule you for tomorrow at <span class="VERBALChar">(TIME)</span>. Which one works best for you and your spouse?</p>

<p>Okay great, what's your email address? I'll send this Zoom link right now. Just click on it now so you can test it out. That way you'll know that it works for when we have our meeting <span class="VERBALChar">(TIME)</span>.</p>
