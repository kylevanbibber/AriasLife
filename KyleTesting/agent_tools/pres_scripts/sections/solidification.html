<span class="VERBALChar"><span class="output memberOutput"></span><span class="couple"> and <span class="output spouseOutput"></span></span></span>, before I leave today, I need to make sure that I'm doing what's in your best interest. So, are you 100% sure that setting aside <span class="VERBALChar">$</span> per month is comfortable for you<span class="couple"> and your family</span>? <span class="TECHNICALChar">Wait for response</span>
	
<p>Because what I don't want is a phone call a week or month from now saying that you cannot afford it. Remember, this is NOT a short-term fix; it is a long-term solution. Do you see any reason why you'd ever have to drop this program and end this protection on your family? <span class="TECHNICALChar">Wait for response</span></p>
	
<p>If any questions come up, good or bad, PROMISE ME that you will call me first before making any changes. Okay?</p>
