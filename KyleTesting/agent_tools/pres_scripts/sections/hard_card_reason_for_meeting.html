<span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, do you get very involved with <span class="VERBALChar groupOutput"></span>? Do you go to your meetings? Ok, no problem, that's exactly why I'm here. Let's take a step back so I can fill you in on what's going on. American Income Life Insurance Company is a division of Globe Life and provides permanent insurance benefits to members of the major unions, like your <span class="VERBALChar groupOutput"></span>, as well as other large associations and groups. In fact, here is the Labor Advisory Board <span class="TECHNICALChar">REFER TO SLIDE</span>. It consists of the top 54 international labor and association leaders from all across North America. Their job is to find the gaps in your current benefits and then fill those gaps with the best possible benefits for members like you. They did all the research and found that American Income was the best option for their members.

<p>As you know, we have benefits set up through work, but the problem is, as soon as we retire, change jobs or lose our job, what happens to all of those benefits? That's right! We lose them because they aren't permanent. The good news is, since you're a member of <span class="VERBALChar groupOutput"></span>, they're making sure that you're set up with permanent benefits TODAY that stay with you FOREVER.</p>

<p>Here's a copy of the letter you received from <span class="VERBALChar groupOutput"></span> <span class="TECHNICALChar">OPEN PREAPPROACH LETTER</span>.

Like it says in the letter, my job is to meet with you for two reasons:</p>
	<ul>
<li>First, I'll explain your benefits package provided to you byâ€¯<span class="VERBALChar groupOutput"></span>.</li>
<li>Second, the most important reason that we're meeting, I'm going to see if you can qualify for the permanent benefits that all of the members are signing up for. I'll let you know right now; it can be really hard to qualify.</li>
