<div style="margin-top: 10px;">I completely understand what you're saying. In fact, the last family was in a similar situation, but they ended up enrolling because this is done on an enrollment basis, and we can only see each family one time. I'm sure you don't mind the fact that when you die, <span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span> <span class="STANDARD">and the kids </span>will get an extra <span class="VERBALChar">SAY THE TOTAL DEATH BENEFIT</span>. If this was offered to you for free I'm sure you would have signed up a long time ago, right? So really, it's just a matter of whether or not <span class="planType hourPower"><strong>2 hours</strong></span><span class="planType recBasic"><strong>the cost of the RECOMMENDED plan</strong></span> per week is comfortable for you. Do you feel like <strong>$$$</strong> per week would take food off the table?
	
<p><strong>NO:</strong> Okay perfect! Let's get you started with <span class="planType hourPower"><strong>2 hours per week</strong></span><span class="planType recBasic"><strong>the RECOMMENDED plan</strong></span>. Where were you born? <span class="TECHNICALChar">ASSUME IT AND START FILLING OUT THE APPLICATION</span></p>
<p><strong>YES:</strong> No problem! Let's get you started with <span class="planType hourPower"><strong>1 hour per week</strong></span><span class="planType recBasic"><strong>the BASIC plan</strong></span>. Where were you born? <span class="TECHNICALChar">ASSUME IT AND START FILLING OUT THE APPLICATION</span></p>
<span class="STANDARD">
<p><strong>IF THEY STOP YOU AFTER THAT:</strong> Let me ask one question. Which part did you like the best, Final Expense Protection or Income Protection? Okay perfect! We can adjust it a little more. Where were you born? <span class="TECHNICALChar">REDUCE DOWN BUT TRY TO KEEP WHAT THEY LIKE</span></p></span>
<span class="SENIOR">
<p><strong>IF THEY STOP YOU AFTER THAT:</strong> No problem! But when you think about this, it's a lot easier to set aside little bit of money every month <span class="couple">while you're both here </span>than what it would be for <span class="couple spouseOutput VERBALChar"></span><span class="single">your family</span> to come up with $20k-$30k all at once after you die. So we're just going to adjust it a little more to keep it comfortable. <span class="TECHNICALChar">REDUCE DOWN TO 75%</span> Okay, we got it down to only $xxx/wk. Where were you born?</p></span>
