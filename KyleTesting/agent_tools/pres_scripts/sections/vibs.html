  <p>Before I get off the call, I like asking everyone:</p>
  <p><b><span class="NON-VERBALChar">V</span>alue</b> - What value did you find in meeting with me today? -Why was it valuable? - Why is that important to you? <span class="VERBALChar">Ask why TWICE</span></p>
  
  <p><b><span class="NON-VERBALChar">I</span>mportant</b>- With that in mind, I have a very important question I'd like to ask you.</p>
  
  <p><b><span class="NON-VERBALChar">B</span>rainstorm</b>- With your permission, I would like to brainstorm with you about some people that you know that will benefit from meeting with me as well.</p>
  
  <p><b><span class="NON-VERBALChar">S</span>uggestions</b>- Give suggestions <span class="VERBALChar">ex. People with kids, married, job switch, retirement</span></p>
