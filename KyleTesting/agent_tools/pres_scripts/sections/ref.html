<p>So <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, we'll take care of your family first, then your close friends, then all of your coworkers. Let's start with your family member that you're closest to. Who would that be?

<strong><u>Collect names:</u></strong>
	<ul style="margin-top: 0px;">
<li>What's their first name?</li>
<li>Last name?</li>
<li>Relationship?</li>
<li><span class="TECHNICALChar">If they can't think of many</span> Most people open their contacts and scroll until they see a close friend or family member. So, who's the first person that you see in your contacts?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Who's your next closest family member/friend/coworker? <span class="TECHNICALChar">Repeat until they run out of names THEN collect #s.</span></p>
	
<strong><u>Collect contact info:</u></strong>

<span class="TECHNICALChar"><strong>Why do you need to know their phone #?</strong></span><br>
That’s a good question. The phone # is how we get the benefits out to them, so we definitely need that. What’s a good phone # for them?

<p><span class="TECHNICALChar"><strong>We still don’t like giving out #s.</strong></span><br>
You know what <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, I’m the exact same way! I usually don’t like giving out my friend’s/family’s information. A few other people said the same thing. However, when you consider the fact that this could save the life of a missing child, help your family save money and be there when they need it most, it becomes one of those things that is just too important to not help out with. What’s a good phone # for them?</p>
