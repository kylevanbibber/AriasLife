<h1>Final Remarks:</h1>
  <p>During the underwriting process, several things may
    happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may receive a phone call asking you to review the questions that I have asked. Should only take a couple minutes.</li>
<li>They may ask for a nurse to come out and ask you some medical questions. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. It's at random. If they do, it's at no cost to you and at your own convenience.</li>
<li>We may be requesting medical records from your doctor.</li>

This last part is very important, and I must explain this to everyone. One of three things could happen when applying for life insurance:
<ol>
<li>You may qualify for the program standard <span class="TECHNICALChar"><b>If healthy say:</b>
    <span style="font-weight: normal; color: black;">Based on what I see, this is most likely to happen.</span></span>
</li>
<li>You could get rated due to anything found in underwriting such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart issues, etc. If the increase is under $10, we'll just build it right into your premium, but if the rating is higher than $10, I'll give you a call first to discuss your options.</li>
<li>You could get declined. If declined, all premiums will be refunded back to you. Does that make sense?</li>
  </ol>

<li>Within about 6-8 weeks you'll receive your policy in the mail.</li>
