<div class="accidental">
Now, if you were to die tomorrow, would it most likely be health related or from an accident? Of course! And if you die suddenly, your family will be caught off guard by that, right? So, they're going to need extra time and money to deal with that problem, right? That's why they also added an Accidental Death Benefit to make sure your family has extra money on top of everything else to take care of debts, mortgage and any other bills that come up after you're gone. That's amazing, right?
