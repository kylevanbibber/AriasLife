	<span class="TECHNICALChar">Click <strong>OPEN EXAMPLE</strong></span>
  <p><span class="VERBALChar"><span class="output memberOutput"></span></span>, here is an example of the Will and Testament that I am sending to you. Start off by listing your name.</p>
  <p><b>Article 1:</b> Is the identification of family. This is where you can list the names of your spouse and children.</p>
  <p><b>Article 2:</b> Is letting your executor know if you have any outstanding debts when you pass, they're going to be responsible for handling ALL THAT with your estate. Whether it be final expenses or medical expenses, things like that.</p>
  <p><b>Article 3:</b> Is where you are going to list all the Tangible property you have and who you want it to go to. It's a fancy way of saying the gifting process. For example, I want my son to have the baseball cards or my daughter to have the jewelry. There is plenty of room on here for everything and you can always add more if you need to.</p>
  <p><b>Article 4:</b> Is another place to put the name of your executor. And if your executor does not serve as your personal representative for whatever reason, they just ask that you list a contingent executor. Do you know who you would put down next?</p>
  <p><b>Article 5:</b> is for any accounts that you have online: This could be bank accounts, social media accounts, Netflix subscriptions, etc. This will be for whoever is in charge and has access to usernames and passwords to close those accounts.</p>
  <p><b>Article 6:</b> This is where you list who you want the guardian to be of any children under the age of 18. Do you have any kids under 18 that you're currently the guardian of?</p>
  <p><b>Article 7:</b> Do you have any pets running around the home? Okay, well this is where you would list the person you want to take care of your pets whenever something happens to you.</p>
  <p><b>Article 10:</b> This is all the special directives that we haven't touched on yet that your family's going to NEED to know about. So, have you guys decided whether you want to be buried or cremated? OK, great. And are you guys going to have a service with that? Alright, and have you guys started prepaying for any of those expenses yet?</p>
  <span class="TECHNICALChar">If YES:</span> There are 3 gray areas that a lot of people don't know about when it comes to pre-paying for your final expenses.
  <ol>
    <li>The first one is that it's dollar for dollar. What that means is... let's say you start prepaying for a $5,000 cremation and die before it's paid off, your immediate family has to come out of pocket with the remaining balance the day of the service.</li>
    <li>Second is if you decide to ever move, your family will have to ship your body/remains back to the place you prepaid because that is where you have to be buried or the money is going to just be wasted. Does that make sense?</li>
    <li>The third one is if the funeral home ever goes out of business, or they decide to change hands to a new owner... They don't have to honor your claims and they're never going to give you a refund. But hey, if that's how you guys want to plan for everything, that's going to go on this page, okay?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Also on this page, I'm sure you have some Life insurance, right?</p>
  <p><span class="TECHNICALChar">If YES:</span> Great! That's going to go here as well.</p>
  <p><span class="TECHNICALChar">If NO:</span> Okay, that's very rare. Is there any reason that you guys have never looked into it?</p>
  <p>So now, what about a funeral benefit plan? Have you got that set up yet? You're going to need both. Because your life insurance is to protect your family's lifestyle so they can pay the bills after you're gone. They receive that money months after you pass away, and the claims process is handled. Does that make sense?</p>
  <p>A Funeral benefit plan pays out right away, so the immediate expense of your funeral is covered, and no one has to set up a go fund me or ask for donations to get it paid for. Does that make sense?</p>
  <p><b>Self-Proving Affidavit:</b> This is also known as the notary page. This is the signature page where you get it notarized.</p>
  <p>Do you Bank with Chase or someone in town? Perfect, they usually always have a notary on staff that can handle that for you. But the notary will sign, and stamp, and it will become a legal document. You will also need two witnesses, but it can't be anyone listed in the Will. Does that make sense?</p>
  <p>Any questions so far on the first part?</p>

 <h3><u>Living Will Section:</u></h3>

    Again, you begin by simply listing your information and the date.

    <p><b>Part A:</b> Just put your initials.</p>

    <p><b>Part B:</b> Mark whether or not you want feeding tubes to receive nutrition and hydration.</p>

    <p><b>Part C:</b> This is for if you are pregnant.</p>

    <p><b>Part D:</b> You can list any other specific requests. We always tell people It's best to look up a list of "Do Not Resuscitate codes" and list any that might apply to you. Do you have any conditions that may complicate things in that regard? Like epilepsy, heart issues, diabetes, or cancer?</p>

	<p><b>II. Designation of Health Care Surrogate:</b> Okay, so now that's going to bring us to the most important page of the Living Will. Now, this is for your health care surrogate. This person will be enforcing your living will. Who would it be for you?</p>

	<p><b>C.</b> This is where you can place limitations on your surrogate's authority. You can leave this blank or if there are certain things you're concerned about, you can list them here.</p>

    <p>At the bottom, you will list two alternate surrogates in the event that your primary is unavailable. Again, make sure they are people you trust. Do you have an idea who this will be? And finally, again, you're going to get this signed and notarized, okay? Any questions?</p>

	<p><b>Schedule A:</b> At the end of your workbook, you'll find Schedule A. This is an entire list of your intangible assets that your digital executor will oversee.</p>

    <p>Things like bank accounts, especially if you do online banking, subscriptions, Netflix, etc. Make sure you list your usernames and passwords so they can access them.</p>

    <p>You will also list your insurance policies... The name of the company and what kind of policy it is, whether it is term or whole life. Once you get your funeral benefit plan set up, that will also go on this page.</p>

    <p>So now when it comes to supplemental policies, do you guys have anything that would pay you directly if you were to get hurt in an accident or develop cancer... like Aflac? If you don't have it, we always recommend this to everybody, especially seniors, because falls have become very common and they're extremely expensive.</p>

    <p>So, that's everything with the first part of the program, which is the Will &amp; Testament. It's a lot, but whenever you're filling this out, you can always call me if you have any questions. But I'll email you over the PDF documents for this, and I'll also be sending you the folder in the mail. Sound good? Okay, great. Onto the second half...</p>
