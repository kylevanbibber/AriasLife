I'm sure you know <span class="children">otherâ€¯</span>families with kids, right? According to the FBI, 460,000 children go missing each year and that number is rising. When unprepared, it can take up to 4 hours for the Police to collect the information needed to put out an Amber Alert. In America, a child goes missing every 40 seconds. That means that, in the 5 minutes we've been talking, about 8 kids have gone missing! That's why it's more important than ever to have this. Statistics show that if a child isn't found within 24hrs, they'll most likely never be found. This kit allows parents to provide the information needed to find their child quickly. <span class="TECHNICALChar">BRIEFLY EXPLAIN THE CHILD SAFE KIT BY REFERRING TO THE SLIDE</span>
