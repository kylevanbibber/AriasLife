    <p>Like I mentioned on the phone, my name is <span class="VERBALChar agentOutput"></span> and I'll be explaining your Child Safe kits that you requested. Please <span class="couple">take a seat where I can see both of you on the screen and </span>feel free to take some notes because these are endorsed by the International Union of Police, it's very important, and we're only able to go over this one time. Sound good?</p>
