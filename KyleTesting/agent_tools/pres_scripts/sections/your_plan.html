<p>Let's review all of the benefits you're getting in the <span class="planType hourPower"><strong>2 hour plan</strong></span><span class="planType recBasic"><strong>RECOMMENDED plan</strong></span>.</p>
	
<ul>
	
<span class="isLicensed">
<li>First is the <strong>Accidental Hospital Benefits</strong>. <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, when you<span class="couple">, or <span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span>,</span> <span class="children"> or any of the kids</span> get hurt and have to go to the <strong><u>emergency room</u></strong>, they're going to send you $250 just for taking time to get the injury looked at. That's for any kind of accident, whether you scrape your knee, need stitches, on or off the job. This money comes to you here at home. 

<p>The only exception to that is when you must stay overnight in the <strong><u>hospital</u></strong>, then they're going to send you $500 per day for up to a year. That ends up being $3,500 per week. <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, when that money comes in, will that help your family? Yeah of course it will.</p>

<p>The only exception to that is when you are in the <strong><u>intensive care</u></strong>, they are going to send you an additional $500 per day for up to two full weeks. The reason why it's $7,000 per week is because usually when you are in intensive care it is a life-or-death situation. Does that make sense? Pretty nice benefits, right?</p>

<li><span class="notLicensed">First</span><span class="isLicensed">Next</span> is the <strong>Freedom of Choice Certifcate</strong> funded by your Whole Life insurance. Remember that's the blank check that will go to your family when you die, and it's guaranteed to pay out. Most people use it for Funeral Expenses but your family can use it for anything they need. <span class="TECHNICALChar">Review Coverage Amount</span><span class="children">â€¯Your (child/children) receive their own Freedom of Choice benefit as well. <span class="TECHNICALChar">Review Coverage Amount</span> They'll have an option to increase it when they're older.</span></li>
<span class="singlecouplechildren">
<span class="STANDARD">
<li>Next is the <strong>Income Protection</strong>. So, when you die unexpectedly from any cause of death, this life insurance means there's still a paycheck coming in for your family. <span class="TECHNICALChar">Review Coverage Amount</span></li>
</span>
</span>
<li>Your <strong>Accidental Death Benefit Rider</strong> adds <span class="VERBALChar">$$$</span> for your family on top of the other benefits when you die from an accident. <span class="TECHNICALChar">Review Coverage Amount</span></li>
</ul>
	<p></p>
<span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span><span class="couple"> and <span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span></span>, not only does this pay out to your family when you die, but there are some amazing living benefits as well!
	<ul>
<li>For example, there's an emergency fund called <strong>Cash Value</strong>. So, down the road, if things ever get tight financially, there will be money built up that you can use however you want.</li>
<li>Also, there's a <strong>Paid-Up Option</strong> that grows. That means that down the road you can stop paying for it and still keep coverage for the rest of your life. That's pretty nice, right?</li>
<li>Additionally, there is a <strong>Terminal Illness Rider</strong>. When you are diagnosed with a terminal illness, you can request to receive half of your coverage to use while you are living. The other half will come to your family when you're gone.</li>
<li>Also, there are <strong>Strike and Layoff Waivers</strong>. If you're on strike, they are going to take care of your premiums for up to 12 months. When you get laid off, they take care of it for up to 3 months!</li>
<li>Most importantly the benefits are <strong>Guaranteed</strong>. This means that if they let you in, it doesn't matter what happens to you after today, the benefits can never be taken away from you. Does that make sense?</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you see why these benefits are so important for your family?</p>
