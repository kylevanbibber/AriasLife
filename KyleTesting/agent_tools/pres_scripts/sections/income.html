The next concern is with your income. <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, if something happens to you unexpectedly, like in a bad car accident, and you were taken from your <span class="couple">family, would <span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span></span><span class="single">loved ones, would they</span> continue to get your paycheck? Of course not, your paycheck vanishes just like that <span class="TECHNICALChar">SNAP FINGERS</span>. <span class="couple">Vice versa, if something happens to you <span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span>, would <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span> continue to get your paycheck? No? Of course not! </span>I'm sure you have a lot of bills that come in every month. But those bills don't pay themselves, do they? Nope!<span class="couple"> And I'm sure you'd both have trouble living off of one income after you've been accustomed to two incomes for so long.</span> So, if you lost your income, would that make it hard on your family? Of course it would.

<p>That's why they added Income Protection. This provides your family with your paycheck every single month for 3-5 years after you're gone. They could also get that as a lump sum payment. They'll be able to use that money for rent, mortgage, children's education, retirement, and so much more. So, even though you're not there physically, you're still there financially taking care of the family. I'm sure you can see why all the members were happy to get Income Protection in place, right?</p>
