	<h1>Child Safe Kit Program:</h1>
</div>
<div class="csreason">
The name of the company that funds the Child Safe ID kits is American Income Life. We also take care of the benefits for all the unions, like the police, firefighters, teachers, and veterans.
	
<p>As you know, we have benefits set up through work, but the problem is, as soon as we retire, change jobs or lose our job, what happens to all of those benefits? That's right! We lose them because they aren't permanent. The Police Unions started to realize that most families requesting these Child Safe ID kits have no benefits at all, or only temporary benefits through work. The good news is, they teamed up with American Income to make sure that you're set up with permanent benefits TODAY that stay with you FOREVER. Does that make sense?</p>

My job is to meet with you for 2 reasons:
<ol>
<li>First, I'll go over the instructions for the Child Safe ID kit and explain your benefits package that comes along with it.</li>
<li>Second, the most important reason that we're meeting, is to help you qualify for the permanent union benefits that all the local police and firefighters have. Now, just because some of the people that you know got in, that doesn't mean you're automatically allowed to enroll. These are permanent benefits that you get to keep for the rest of your life. But you do have to qualify. If you're too high of a risk, they can't let you in.</li>
