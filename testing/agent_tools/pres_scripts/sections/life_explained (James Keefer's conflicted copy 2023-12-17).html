<div class="life_explained">
<span class="VERBALChar"><span class="memberOutput"></span><span class="couple"> and <span class="spouseOutput"></span></span></span>, its <span class="VERBALChar" id="current-year"></span>, and most people already have life insurance. But the problem is that most of them don’t know what they have or how it all works. There are over 46 different variations of life insurance but it really only boils down to two main types: <strong>Whole Life</strong> and <strong>Term</strong>
<p><strong>Whole Life</strong> is for <strong>"<u>WHEN</u>"</strong> you die. Because it’s 100% guaranteed to put a check in your family’s hands, no matter when or how you die. It also builds CASH VALUE, so down the road if you get into a bind, you can pull some money from your policy. It also builds PAID UP options. So, down the road, you can stop paying but still keep your life insurance.</p>
	
<p><strong>TERM/WORK</strong> is for <strong>"<u>IF</u>"</strong> you die during a certain period of time. It’s used to cover temporary problems like protecting your income and debts. When you get older, the premiums increase and eventually it terminates and premium payments stop.</p>
	
<p>So, Whole Life is permanent and is used to cover Final Expenses and more. Term is temporary and is mainly used to cover income and debts. Does that make sense?</p>
	
<p><span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, the Top 5 Causes of Death in America are:</p>
	<ol>
<li>Heart Attack</li>
<li>Stroke</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Lung Problems</li>
<li>Accidents (leading cause of death under 44 years old)</li>
		</ol>
<p>God forbid you were to die tomorrow, which of these top 5 do you think it would be? That would probably catch your family off guard, right? Exactly! So with that being said, they would need extra TIME and MONEY to deal with that PROBLEM, right? Do you see why it’s so important to have protection in place for your family?</p>
