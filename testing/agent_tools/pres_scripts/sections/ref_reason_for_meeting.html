	<h1>Sponsorship Program:</h1>

<div class="refreason">
Did you talk with <span class="VERBALChar sponsorOutput"></span> to find out why we're meeting and what they set up for your family? (<b>Yes or No</b>) Ok, I will back up and fill you in on what is going on.
	
<p><span class="VERBALChar sponsorOutput"></span> is a member in good standing with <span class="VERBALChar"><span class="nonunion">AMERICAN INCOME</span><span class="union"><span class="output sponsorgroupOutput"></span></span></span> and was allowed to extend some of their benefits to a few close friends and family members. <span class="VERBALChar sponsorOutput"></span> knew these benefits would be perfect for you and your family so they wanted me to take care of you right away. We also take care of the benefits for all the unions, like the police, firefighters, teachers, and veterans.</p>
	
<p>As you know, we have benefits set up through work, but the problem is, as soon as we retire, change jobs or lose our job, what happens to all of those benefits? That's right! We lose them because they aren't permanent. Our company, American Income, started to realize that too many families have no benefits at all, or only temporary benefits through work. The good news is, they teamed up with the unions to make sure that you're set up with permanent benefits TODAY that stay with you FOREVER. Does that make sense?</p>

My job is to meet with you for 2 reasons:
<ol>
<li>First, I'll explain your benefits package that <span class="VERBALChar"><span class="output sponsorOutput"></span></span> set up for your family.</li>
<li>Second, the most important reason that we're meeting, is to help you qualify for the permanent union benefits that <span class="VERBALChar"><span class="output sponsorOutput"></span></span> made available to you. Now, just because some of the people that you know got in, that doesn't mean you're automatically allowed to enroll. These are permanent benefits that you get to keep for the rest of your life. But you do have to qualify. If you're too high of a risk, they can't let you in.</li>
