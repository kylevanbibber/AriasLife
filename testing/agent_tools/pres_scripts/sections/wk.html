The next benefit provided to you is your <strong>Will Kit</strong>. Establishing a legally sound will is an essential step in safeguarding the well-being of your loved ones and the protection of your assets. However, creating a will can be a complex and costly endeavor. In fact, in North America, the expense for a will can range from $940 to $1500 per individual. What's even more alarming is the number of families who have yet to prepare a will. They realize that everyone has a beneficiary for their bank accounts and their life insurance, but very few people have a will set up to take care of their children and the lives they leave behind. So here is your Will Kit. It comes with instructions but if you do have any other questions while you are filling it out, you can give me a call.
