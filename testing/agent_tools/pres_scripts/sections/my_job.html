Now my job is to help you get enrolled into the benefits. <span class="VERBALChar"><span class="memberOutput"></span><span class="couple"> and <span class="spouseOutput"></span></span></span>, let's face it, we're all going to die-we don't have a choice. Either we take care of this now, or someone in your immediate family (brother, sister, child) will be forced to deal with this later when something happens. Does that make sense?
