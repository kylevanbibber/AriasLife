The FIRST no-cost benefit is your <b>Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment</b> benefit. Here's how it works: If you die from an accident, it will pay <span class="VERBALChar"><span class="output addOutput">$3,000</span></span> to <span class="couple"><span class="VERBALChar"><span class="output spouseOutput"></span></span></span><span class="single">your beneficiary</span>. It may not seem like much, but if you die suddenly, this can help cover some of the expenses that your family will be dealing with after you're gone. Also, if you were to lose both hands, both feet, sight in both eyes, or any combination of the two, it will pay <span class="VERBALChar"><span class="output addOutput">$3,000</span></span> to you. And if you're just having a bad day and you lose one hand, one foot, or sight in one eye, it will pay out <span class="VERBALChar"><span class="output addOutput" data-show-half="true">$1,500</span></span> to you. This is provided at no cost to you by <span class="VERBALChar"><span class="output groupOutput"></span></span> for being a member in good standing. Does that make sense?

<p>Last year our company paid out $4.67 million in these no-cost accidental policies. Make sure to put your certificate somewhere safe so that when something happens, you'll have proof of it. And I'll email this for you to print off. Make sense?</p>
