	Because of these concerns, the Labor Advisory Board and American Unions created a program called the Hour Power program. <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, are you familiar with the hour power philosophy? Okay! Well, the Hour Power philosophy is based on a very old union principle where all members take the first two hours of their wages each week and set it aside to protect themselves and provide for their family's financial future. Any financial planner would tell you to set aside 4-6 hours each week. So, two hours each week is a small amount of your income, right? And if you were to set aside just two hours per week to protect your family, that's not going to change your lifestyle any, is it? Of course not. So, that means that all the members can afford it. Does that make sense?

<span class="planType recBasic">
    <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, your permanent benefits program is based on a very old union principle where all members take just 5% of their income and set it aside to protect themselves and provide for their family's financial future. Any financial planner would tell you to set aside 10-15% of your income. Now, 5% is a small amount of your income, right? And if you were to set aside just 5% to protect your family, that's not going to change your lifestyle any is it? Of course not. Your program is based on ONLY 5%. So that means that all the members can afford it. Does that make sense?

	Now, <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span><span class="couple"> and <span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span></span>, everyone's situation is a little bit different. My responsibility is to show you what just 5% will do to protect your family financially. Sound good? Okay great!
