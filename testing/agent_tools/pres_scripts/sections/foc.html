<span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span><span class="couple"> and <span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span></span>, the first area that they are concerned with is your Funeral and Final Expenses. Now, let me ask, have<span class="couple"> either one of</span> you ever had to plan a funeral?
	
<p><strong>IF YES:</strong> Sorry to hear that. If you don't mind me asking, who was it? How did you end up paying for it? How much did it cost?</p>
	
<p><span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, when you die, who will be handling your Final Expenses? Here's the <strong>PROBLEM</strong>. The average cost for Final Expenses TODAY is between $10k-$15k. Down the road, it will cost a lot more due to inflation! Most families didn't have that kind of money just lying around. Even if they did, it definitely wasn't meant for a funeral. A big problem is that the funeral home wants half of the money upfront and the other half within 30 days. The last thing you would ever want to do is pull money from savings, a retirement plan, or a 401k. That money is designed for you to live on, not for you to die on. I'm sure you can imagine why this was a big concern, right? <span class="TECHNICALChar">LET THEM AGREE</span> Exactly!</p>
	
<p>Since the average cost for Final Expenses today is $10k-$15k, how much do you think they were 20 years ago? That's pretty close! It was about half, which was $5k-$7k. So, what happened over those 20 years? That's right! The price went up due to inflation! The cost of everything doubles every 20 years. How much do you think it will cost 20 years from now? That's right, $20k-$30k! Based on your age, life expectancy and current inflation rates, you're going to need $##,### for your Final Expenses. You can see why that's a huge problem, right?</p>

<p>In order to solve these problems and to ensure that your family will never be burdened with the cost of YOUR Final Expenses, they set up your Freedom of Choice certificate! The way this works is like a blank check. <span class="VERBALChar memberOutput"></span>, when you die, <span class="couple"><span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span>, you</span><span class="single">your beneficiary</span> will just bring this certificate down to the funeral home but keep it a secret until after negotiating the price! Because, if they know that you're covered for $30k, how much do you think they're going to charge? Exactly! <span class="couple"><span class="VERBALChar spouseOutput"></span>, once you</span><span class="single">Once they</span> get the price, <span class="couple">you'll</span><span class="single">they'll</span> just write the correct amount on the back of the certificate, hand it to the funeral director, and everything will be taken care of; services, casket, embalming and everything. Our company will cut a check to the funeral home for the amount you negotiated. Another check will be sent to your family to take care of medical bills, and any other debt that is left behind. I'm sure you can see why all the members were so excited about this, right?</p>
